ansible-role-sysctl
===================

Applies sysctl settings.

Role Variables
--------------

`sysctl_default_settings` : The default configuration for sysctl.

You can override this variable to change the default values (unless you use `hash_behaviour=merge`).
The default are based on ansible-role-harden-linux values ie recommendations
from Google Compute Cloud OS images and from UFW firewall.

For more information about this settings have a look at:
- https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/images/building-custom-os
- https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/images/configuring-imported-images
- https://git.launchpad.net/ufw/tree/conf/sysctl.conf

The 3 following variables are merged with `sysctl_default_settings` to build the final setting applied to the host.

`sysctl_settings` : This variable allows updating the default settings for all hosts.

`sysctl_group_settings` : This variable should be set for a group to update the settings for that group.

`sysctl_host_settings` : This variable should be set for a host to update the settings for that host.

I want to credit the following sources that inspired me in writing this module:

- [ansible-role-harden-linux](https://github.com/githubixx/ansible-role-harden-linux) by Robert Wimmer were I took all the sysctl initial configuration. This role can be considered a simplified fork of it :)

- The 4 variables override levels default/normal/group/host idea from [nftables](https://github.com/ipr-cnrs/nftables) role by Jérémy Gardais (himself inspired from [Mike Gleason firewall role](https://github.com/mikegleasonjr/ansible-role-firewall)).
