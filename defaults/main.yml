# Most of this settings are recommendations from Google which they use for
# their Google Compute Cloud OS images and from UFW firewall.
#
# Add more settings by either replacing "sysctl_default_settings" or
# overriding them by a merge using the "sysctl_settings",
# "sysctl_group_settings" and "sysctl_host_settings" variables.
# the first is met to be used to globally change the settings,
# the second is for group override and the last for host override.
#
# For more information about this settings have a look at:
# https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/images/building-custom-os
# https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/images/configuring-imported-images
# With ufw package installed: /etc/ufw/sysctl.conf
#

# This would be cool but doesn't work with UFW very well so leave it out:
